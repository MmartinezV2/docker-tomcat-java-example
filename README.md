# Docker Tomcat Java Example & Sticky Session on Apache2 Balancer

[![Software License][ico-license]](LICENSE.md)

This is an example for running a stack of two docker container's with tomcat (with two java servlets examples) and an Apache2 reverse http proxy as a Load Balancer to show the use of Tomcat's Sticky Session features.

This is a modified version by Manuel Mart√≠nez from Maik Hilker's one [maik-hilkers-project].

This example adds:

  - Build servlets on a gradle docker container (local gradle install not needed)
  - Use of multistage docker builds to first build servlets and then a small customized Tomcat image with our servlets deployed on it.
  - Two example servlets from Tomcat9-Examples: HelloWorld and Session
  - Shows the use of Sticky Sessions with Apache Reverse Proxy http balancer
