# Docker Tomcat Java Example

[![Software License][ico-license]](LICENSE.md)

This is an example for running a stack of two docker container's with tomcat (with two java servlets examples) and an Apache reverse http proxy as a Load Balancer to show the use of Tomcat's Sticky Session features.

This is a modified version by Manuel Mart√≠nez from Maik Hilker's one [maik-hilters-project].

This example adds:

  - Build servlets on a gradle docker container
  - Use of multistage builds to build a small customized Tomcat image with our servlets
  - Two example servlets from Tomcat9-Examples: HelloWorld and Session
  - Shows the use of Sticky Sessions with Apache Reverse Proxy http balancer
